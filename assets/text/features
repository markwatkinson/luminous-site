==Luminous aims to be a modern syntax highlighter for PHP==

  * Luminous is powerful: it uses lexical scanners to highlight source code, which means syntax highlighting is more accurate in complex cases than many simplified highlighters.
  * It's powerful enough to do clever things like:
    # Handle mixed [demo/show/16 PHP/HTML/CSS/JavaScript] and [demo/show/17 Ruby on Rails-like] language nesting,
    # [demo/show/4 highlight source code inside diff/patch files],
    # correctly highlight [demo/show/10 Ruby's string interpolation and balanced delimiters].
  * Highlights a range of [page/languages common languages].
  * The calling API is small and neat, so it's easy to use.
  * Includes transparent caching so highlighting incurs only a one-time overhead.
  * Comes with 6 colour themes, yes, six! And it's easy to write your own with CSS.
  * Outputs to HTML and LaTeX:
    * HTML output is HTML4, XHTML strict/loose and HTML5 valid.
    * LaTeX output is themed by CSS. Luminous uses its own CSS lexer to tokenize and then parse theming stylesheets.
  * It's well [docs/show/index documented].
  * Luminous has a large test database and is frequently tested against pseudo-random input, so you can feel safe using it.
