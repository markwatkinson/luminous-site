# TODO:

  + Allow updating of code submissions
  + Revision history of code submissions
  + Centralise the default luminous theme (currently declared in two places I
    think, grep for zenophilia)
  + I forgot what I was about to write but there's definitely something.
  + Deploy/packaging script: needs to generate list of downloads, checksums,
    get a stable copy of Luminous.
